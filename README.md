# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - C Implementation

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This is a unique collection of fundamental algorithms and data structures, all implemented exclusively in **C**. It is designed to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-understand reference for anyone learning or working with DSA concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees (Binary, AVL, etc.)**
- **Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)**

Each algorithm and data structure is carefully written, documented, and organized for clear understanding and easy access.

## Key Features

- **Unique Collection**: All code is written from scratch and not copied from any source, ensuring originality and ownership.
- **Exclusively in C**: Every data structure and algorithm is implemented using the C programming language.
- **Well-Commented Code**: Code is accompanied by comments for easy understanding and learning purposes.
- **Optimized Implementations**: Efforts have been made to ensure optimal solutions and efficient code for various algorithms and data structures.
